                <p>
                    This assignment will give you an opportunity to create a
                    Graphical User Interface (GUI) and to apply the techniques
                    for designing good software that you have been learning in
                    class.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Part 1 of the assignment requires you to create a
                    CSSE1001/7030 queueing application to mimic the one that is
                    used currently for CSSE1001/7030 pracs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    An example of what this queue should look like is below
                </p>

                <div class="card">
                    <a name="fig_basic_gui"></a>
                    <div class="card-image">
                        <img src="public/images/base.png"
                             alt="Image of Basic GUI Example">
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-content">
                        <span class="card-title">Basic GUI Example</span>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Unlike the existing web queue, however, the application you
                    write is to be desktop application accessed rather than a
                    website queue. The queue you produce must be written entirely
                    in python using tkinter. You are not required to make the
                    application work with multiple users over a network.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The GUI in your software is to have the same labels, buttons
                    and text as the existing web application, but the "join queue"
                    buttons will have slightly different functions. When a user
                    presses either the "Request quick help" button or "Request
                    long help" button, your software must display a dialog box
                    which asks the user for their name. Once they have entered
                    their name, your software then needs to join the user to the
                    queue, display their name on the screen, and regularly update
                    the amount of time they have been waiting on the queue.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When a student is added to the queue, they must be added in
                    such a way that no student who has asked a greater number of
                    questions in the past 24 hours is ahead of them. A student
                    must also be able to remove themselves from the queue by
                    pressing the red button (leaving voluntarily) or the green
                    button (have had their question answered).

                </p>

                <p>
                    You are not required to implement days changing -
                    the "Questions Today" section should be the questioned
                    asked since opening the application.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2 class="header">Queue Header</h2><a name="sec_queue_header"></a>

                <p>
                    The first task when implementing part 1 of the assignment is
                    to create a GUI for the top half of the queue. The half includes
                    the yellow notice at the top, the blue and green headers for
                    each type of question, a list of example questions and buttons
                    for requesting help.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This section demonstrated in the section below.
                </p>

                <div class="card">
                    <a name="fig_basic_gui"></a>
                    <div class="card-image">
                        <img src="public/images/header.png"
                             alt="Image of Basic GUI Example">
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-content">
                        <span class="card-title">Queue Header</span>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="header">Student Queue</h2><a name="sec_student_queue"></a>

                <p>
                    The second task is to implement a table that lists students
                    in a queue. This section should have the base functionality
                    of being able to add students to the queue by clicking the
                    request help button. It should also have the ability to
                    remove students from the queue by clicking either the red
                    button or the green button.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To receive marks for this section you do not need
                    to implement the functionality listed in the functionality
                    section. This means that the "Questions Today" and "Time"
                    columns may contain the placeholders of "0" and "a few seconds"
                    respectively.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This section demonstrated in the section below.
                </p>

                <div class="card">
                    <a name="fig_basic_gui"></a>
                    <div class="card-image">
                        <img src="public/images/queue.png"
                             alt="Image of Basic GUI Example">
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-content">
                        <span class="card-title">Student Queue</span>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="header">Full Queue Functionality</h2><a name="sec_functionality"></a>

                <p>
                    The final task of part 1 is to implement the full functionality
                    of the queue (minus networking). This functionality is documented below.
                </p>

                <ul class="browser-default">
                    <li>
                        Keep track of how many times a question has been asked
                        by the same student since opening the application.
                        This number should not be updated if the they were removed
                        by clicking the red button.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Keep track of the approximate time a student has been
                        waiting on the queue.
                        <ul>
                            <li>< 1 minute - display 'a few seconds ago'</li>
                            <li>= 1 minute - display '1 minute'</li>
                            <li>> 1 minute - display 'X minute' where X is the amount of minutes</li>
                            <li>= 1 hour - display '1 hour'</li>
                            <li>> 1 hour - display 'X hours' where X is the amount of hours</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prevent the same student from joining multiple times
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Display the average wait time for the queue. e.g.
                        An average wait of about 12 minutes for
                        2 students.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Order the queue in such a way that no student who has
                        asked a greater number of questions is ahead of any other
                        student.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In order to keep track of how long students have been waiting
                    on the queue, you should record a timestamp using the time module.

                <h2 class="header">Additional Features</h2><a name="sec_additional_features"></a>

                <p>
                    Part 2 of the assignment requires you to add one or more
                    new features to the software developed in Part 1.
                    To obtain a 7 in CSSE1001/7030, you must obtain more
                    than 50% of the marks for Part 2 of the Assignment.

                    It is up to you which additional feature(s) you add,
                    but it must be substantial enough to demonstrate your
                    expertise in writing software.

                    Some suggested example features are:

                </p>

                <ol class="browser-default">
                    <li>
                        A python internet based queue
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provision of a game which the user can play while
                        they are waiting to have their questions answered
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    All additional features must be written in Python.
                    To appraise the suitability of a given additional feature,
                    you are advised to consult with tutors or post a private query on Piazza.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For Part 2 of the Assignment you must also submit a
                    pdf document which describes the additional feature(s)
                    you have implemented, a brief user manual on the
                    how to interact with your additional feature software,
                    and the approach you took to writing the code.
                </p>
            </section>

        </section>

        <section>

            <h2 class="header">Masters Task</h2><a name="sec_masters"></a>

            <p>
                Masters students (i.e. CSSE7030 students) must do an additional task.
                They must implement a new top level window to display statistics
                about the history of questions that have been asked.
            </p>

            <p>
                The window must display the following information. The style
                is left up to the discretion of the student and your window will
                be marked on the sophistication of the styling of the window.
            </p>

            <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>
                    A leader board of students who have asked the most questions
                    for both types of questions.
                    It should display a minimum of 10 students for each.
                </li>
                <li>Mean wait time for both types of questions.</li>
                <li>Median wait time for both types of questions.</li>
                <li>Mode wait time for both types of questions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Marks can still be earned for the style of the window without
                having it implemented correctly.
            </p>

                allowed, so ensure that you have submitted an almost complete version of the assignment well before the
                submission deadline of 8:30pm. Your latest, on time, submission will be marked. Ensure that you submit the
                correct version of your assignment. In the event of exceptional circumstances, you may submit a request
                for an extension. See the <a
                    href="http://www.courses.uq.edu.au/student_section_loader.php?section=5&profileId=92705">course
                profile</a> for details of how to apply for an extension.
            </p>

            <p>
                Requests for extensions must be made <strong>no later</strong> than 48 hours prior to the submission
                deadline. The expectation is that with less than 48 hours before an assignment is due it should be
                substantially completed and submittable. Applications for extension, and any supporting documentation
                (e.g. medical certificate), must be submitted via <a href="https://my.uq.edu.au/">my.UQ</a>. You must
                retain the original documentation for a <em>minimum period</em> of six months to provide as verification
                should you be requested to do so.
