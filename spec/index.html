                <p>
                    This assignment will give you an opportunity to create a
                    Graphical User Interface (GUI) and to apply the techniques
                    for designing good software that you have been learning in
                    class.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Part 1 of the assignment requires you to create a
                    CSSE1001/7030 queueing application to mimic the one that is
                    used currently for CSSE1001/7030 pracs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    An example of what this queue should look like is below
                </p>

                <div class="card">
                    <a name="fig_basic_gui"></a>
                    <div class="card-image">
                        <img src="public/images/queue.png"
                             alt="Image of Basic GUI Example">
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-content">
                        <span class="card-title">Basic GUI Example</span>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Unlike the existing web queue, however, the application you
                    write is to be desktop application accessed rather than a
                    website queue. The queue you produce must be written entirely
                    in python using tkinter. You are not required to make the
                    application work with multiple users over a network.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The GUI in your software is to have the same labels, buttons
                    and text as the existing web application, but the "join queue"
                    buttons will have slightly different functions. When a user
                    presses either the "Request quick help" button or "Request
                    long help" button, your software must display a dialog box
                    which asks the user for their name. Once they have entered
                    their name, your software then needs to join the user to the
                    queue, display their name on the screen, and regularly update
                    the amount of time they have been waiting on the queue.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When a student is added to the queue, they must be added in
                    such a way that no student who has asked a greater number of
                    questions in the past 24 hours is ahead of them. A student
                    must also be able to remove themselves from the queue by
                    pressing the red button (leaving voluntarily) or the green
                    button (have had their question answered).

                </p>

                <p>
                    You are not required to implement days changing -
                    the "Questions Today" section should be the questioned
                    asked since opening the application.
                </p>

                <h2 class="header">Additional Features</h2><a name="sec_additional_features"></a>

                <p>
                    Part 2 of the assignment requires you to add one or more
                    new features to the software developed in Part 1.
                    To obtain a 7 in CSSE1001/7030, you must obtain more
                    than 50% of the marks for Part 2 of the Assignment.

                    It is up to you which additional feature(s) you add,
                    but it must be substantial enough to demonstrate your
                    expertise in writing software.

                    Some suggested example features are:

                </p>

                <ol class="browser-default">
                    <li>
                        A python internet based queue
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provision of a game which the user can play while
                        they are waiting to have their questions answered
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    All additional features must be written in Python.
                    To appraise the suitability of a given additional feature,
                    you are advised to consult with tutors or post a private query on Piazza.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For Part 2 of the Assignment you must also submit a
                    pdf document which describes the additional feature(s)
                    you have implemented, a brief user manual on the
                    how to interact with your additional feature software,
                    and the approach you took to writing the code.
                </p>

            <h2 class="header">Masters Task</h2><a name="sec_masters"></a>

            <p>
                Masters students (i.e. CSSE7030 students) must do an additional task.
                They must create a menubar which has a “Statistics” tab in it.
                When this tab is activated it displays the options
                “Mean”, “Median” and “Mode”. When one of these options is selected
                it triggers respectively a display of the mean, median and modal
                time to wait for questions to be answered on both the short and
                long question queues for the previous day.

                As apart of this assessment, you will be required to discuss
                your code with a tutor. This discussion will occur in the week
                following your assignment submission in the practical session
                to which you are enrolled. <strong>You must attend this session
                to obtain marks for this assignment.</strong>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 class="header">Assignment Submission</h2><a name="sec_submission"></a>

            <p>
                Your assignment must be submitted via the assignment three submission link on Blackboard.

                You must submit a file, <code>a2.py</code>, containing your submission for this assignment.
                You do not need to submit any other files.
            </p>

            <p>
                Late submission of the assignment will <strong>not</strong> be accepted. Do not wait until the last
                minute to submit your assignment, as the time to upload it may make it late. Multiple submissions are
                allowed, so ensure that you have submitted an almost complete version of the assignment well before the
                submission deadline of 6pm. Your latest, on time, submission will be marked. Ensure that you submit the
                correct version of your assignment. In the event of exceptional circumstances, you may submit a request
                for an extension. See the <a
                    href="http://www.courses.uq.edu.au/student_section_loader.php?section=5&profileId=92705">course
                profile</a> for details of how to apply for an extension.
            </p>

            <p>
                Requests for extensions must be made <strong>no later</strong> than 48 hours prior to the submission
                deadline. The expectation is that with less than 48 hours before an assignment is due it should be
                substantially completed and submittable. Applications for extension, and any supporting documentation
                (e.g. medical certificate), must be submitted via <a href="https://my.uq.edu.au/">my.UQ</a>. You must
                retain the original documentation for a <em>minimum period</em> of six months to provide as verification
                should you be requested to do so.
